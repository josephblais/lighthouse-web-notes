# Troubleshooting Guide

Ask yourself:

**Have I...**

…pseudo-coded the solution?

…googled the error message I am getting?

…actually *READ* the error message?

…double-checked my syntax?

…linted my code?

…pair programmed or gotten a peer to code review?

…rubber-ducked the problem?

If the answer to all the above questions is yes, then you have done your due dilligence and should be calling a mentor over.
